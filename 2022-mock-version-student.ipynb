    "# Welcome to the MOCK  MLBD final exam (Spring 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam questions are contained in this Jupyter Notebook. The `data` folder contains the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The logistical details, rules, and guidelines pertaining to the exam are stated below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline and Submission\n",
    "**Exam date:** Wednesday, June 1, 2022   \n",
    "**Exam start:** 08:20 am (CEST)   \n",
    "**Exam end:** 9:20 am (CEST) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "This exam consists of two parts, a Moodle quiz with conceptual questions and programming exercises in this notebook. Be sure to answer the conceptual questions and upload this notebook to Moodle. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of issues with Moodle, send your file named as \"SCIPER_Firstname_Lastname.ipynb\" via email to paola.mejia@epfl.ch, subject \"[MLBD] Exam notebook\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any environment. We recommend using EPFL's Noto environment, accessible through the link: [https://noto.epfl.ch/](https://noto.epfl.ch/). We prepared a Python environment with all the Python packages that you might need for the exam, in the default EPFL's Noto installation. If you want to use some additional packages, feel free to install and use them in a virtual environment. In this case, it is your own responsibility to make sure that your environment is functional and that your results can be properly interpreted for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation (in markdown). Add a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, and your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When asked for plots, please include all the needed decorations, namely title, x/y-axis labels, appropriate x/y-ticks, legend, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We will grade your notebook as is, which means that only the results showed in your evaluated code cells will be considered. Please be sure to submit a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. We will not run the notebook for you. Interactive plots, such as those generated using `plotly`, should be **strictly avoided**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You can use all the online resources you want except for communication tools (emails, web chats, forums, phone, etc.). Remember, this is not a project assignment. Therefore, no teamwork is allowed."

However, the consistently high dropout rate of MOOC learners is a major issue.
